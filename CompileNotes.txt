Configuration Properties --> Linker --> General --> Additional Library Directories
-This needs to point to the detours lib directory, the MFC42 lib directory, and the AsmJit directory
-The easiest way to do this is to place both the detours and MFC42 directories into the solution directory, and to place compiled AsmJit libraries into the TobEx\AsmJit directory
